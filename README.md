It all started when I wrote an HTML parser on Python to get photos from a VK group and send them to Telegram using its Bot API. Then I wrote a couple more bots with more features. And then I decided to switch to Java. This branch is the Python version (full but abandoned), the active in-dev branch is called "java" but it's really far from catching up to "python" branch in terms of bots' features because I started rewriting everything from scratch.
