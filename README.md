# What's this?

This branch is an archived version of an attempt I made in the autumn of 2020 to rewrite my Telegram bots in Java.

Unfinished & abandoned.

# Where should I go?

Probably to the `dev` branch. Or the `main`/`master` (whatever it is).

Alternatively, you can take a look at the `python` branch to see the original source code from the summer of 2020.
